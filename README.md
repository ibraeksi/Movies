# Movie Review Score Prediction based on Elevator Pitch

In this project, I developed an RNN combining natural language processing and numerical features
to predict movie review scores based on provided summary, genres and runtime. I trained the model using about 18000 movies from the TMDB movie dataset available on Kaggle.

Additionally, I developed a plot-based recommender using TF-IDF vectorizer to provide the 10 most similar
movies to the idea provided by the user.
